			<h1>MGS Research Packages</h1> Choose from either the Basic Research or the Custom Search packages below. (prices effective as of May 1, 2015) 
			<p>
<h2>Research Assistance
</h2><p>
If you are seeking assistance from the Manitoba Genealogical Society (MGS), you need to identify your problems before we can help you.  Although we have resources from many countries, our main resources and collections are those about the province of Manitoba.  We can however point you in the right direction when and if your research indicates that your Manitoba roots have been exhausted and you need to move on to another province or country.

Your first course of action should be to follow all possible leads – family, home and community sources, and oral interviews with relatives just to mention a few.  Visit the MGS Getting Started section on this website.  It will introduce you to the beginnings of your family’s story.  Check also the Library and Resource Centre for holdings to assist you in your research.  Organize your material before you visit our library or contact us.  This will make it easier for our volunteers to help you.  Use only copies, not original documents when you visit us or send requests through the mail.

If you wish to have assistance from MGS volunteers your next step is to contact us by selecting the package below that you require. MGS will undertake genealogical research within our sources on a fee-for-service basis
			<p>
<h1>Basic Research Service Package</h1><p>
